# What's this?

 This project was insprited in [SQLite4Unity3d](https://github.com/codecoding/SQLite4Unity3d).

 When I started with Unity3d development I needed to use SQLite in my project and it was very hard to me to find a place with simple instructions on how to make it work. All I got were links to paid solutions on the Unity3d's Assets Store and a lot of different and complicated tutorials.

 At the end, I decided that there should be a simpler way and I created **SqlCipher4Unity3D**, a plugin that helps you to use SqlCipher in your Unity3d projects in a clear and easy way.

 It uses the great [sqlite-net](https://github.com/praeclarum/sqlite-net) library as a base so you will have **Linq besides sql**. For a further reference on what possibilities you have available with this library I encourage you to visit [its github repository](https://github.com/praeclarum/sqlite-net).

* Note: _SQLite4Unity3d uses only the synchronous part of sqlite-net, so all the calls to the database are synchronous._

 If you want to know more about why I created this plugin you can read more [here](http://www.codecoding.com/sqlite4unity3d-using-sqlite-net-library-and-unity3d-free-edition/).

# Support Platforms
- Editor (Windows 32/64bit, macOS 64bit)
- StandardAlone (Windows 32/64bit)
- Android
- iOS

# Watchout
* If You are on Windows, need to `libeay32.dll` from https://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/Binaries
* If You are on iOS, need to modify [link.xml](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/iphone-playerSizeOptimization.html) for prevent stripping by Unity.
* Check [Issues](https://github.com/netpyoung/SqlCipher4Unity3D/issues)


# The fast track
 All you have to do to start using it in your project:

1. [Download this .unitypackage](https://github.com/netpyoung/SqlCipher4Unity3D/raw/master/SqlCipher4Unity3D-v1.0.1.unitypackage), extract its content on your Unity3D Project. It contains the dlls that Unity3d will need to access sqlite.
4. **Youâ€™re done!**

# Sqlchipher lib version
* android : 3.5.9
  - https://www.zetetic.net/sqlcipher/sqlcipher-for-android/
  - precompiled : https://github.com/sqlcipher/sqlcipher-android-tests/tree/master/app/libs



# Example
If you want to try it I've uploaded a small example that you will be able to find in the "Example" folder. Download the folder and open it with Unity3d to give it a try. It contains classes that will help you to start.

# LICENCE

## Sqlite
![sqlite](sqlite370_banner.gif)
* https://sqlite.org/copyright.html

~~~
All of the code and documentation in SQLite has been dedicated to the public domain by the authors. All code authors, and representatives of the companies they work for, have signed affidavits dedicating their contributions to the public domain and originals of those signed affidavits are stored in a firesafe at the main offices of Hwaci. Anyone is free to copy, modify, publish, use, compile, sell, or distribute the original SQLite code, either in source code form or as a compiled binary, for any purpose, commercial or non-commercial, and by any means.

The previous paragraph applies to the deliverable code and documentation in SQLite - those parts of the SQLite library that you actually bundle and ship with a larger application. Some scripts used as part of the build process (for example the "configure" scripts generated by autoconf) might fall under other open-source licenses. Nothing from these build scripts ever reaches the final deliverable SQLite library, however, and so the licenses associated with those scripts should not be a factor in assessing your rights to copy and use the SQLite library.

All of the deliverable code in SQLite has been written from scratch. No code has been taken from other projects or from the open internet. Every line of code can be traced back to its original author, and all of those authors have public domain dedications on file. So the SQLite code base is clean and is uncontaminated with licensed code from other projects.
